# Watson Discovery for Machine Learning Text choices

Given a collection of reviews utilize the Watson Discovery tool to decide which book/books to buy.

## Query Decisions

Based on the reviews and the available options from Watson we can construct a vast variety of queries for identifying books worth purchasing. Below I will outline 3 options.

1.  Possibly the simplest query. Return the top ten books with positive sentiment grouped by title with the keywords machine learning (allowing 3 character misspellings).

2.  Slightly more complex query. Return the same as above with the keyword python (allowing 2 character misspellings) as an additional filter.

3.  All out crazy. Forget sentiment. I want a book focused on machine learning with a heavy dose of algorithms and statistics.
